# Dog-Breed-Classifier

In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. If the image is of a human and not a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

If you'd like to use this notebook to do any re-training on the dataset you can grab it at the links below.
